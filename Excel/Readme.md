# Salary Trend Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes salary trends for data-related roles (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Scientist) across U.S. states and company sizes using Power Query in Microsoft Excel. The analysis provides insights into compensation patterns to inform workforce planning and market research.

## Objectives
- Analyze average minimum and maximum salaries by state, company size, and role type.
- Identify high-paying regions (e.g., Delaware: $331,000 avg. max salary) and roles (e.g., Data Scientist: $147,874 avg. max salary).
- Support strategic decision-making with data-driven insights.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Aggregated salary data from multiple U.S. states and company sizes.
- **Tools**: Power Query for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL); Microsoft Excel for analysis.
- **Process**: Cleaned and transformed raw data, calculated averages, and segmented results by state, company size (e.g., 51-200 employees: $148,504 avg. max salary), and role.

## Key Findings
- Delaware offers the highest average maximum salary ($331,000), followed by North Carolina ($179,000).
- Data Scientists command the highest salaries among roles ($147,874 avg. max).
- Companies with 51-200 employees offer the highest average maximum salaries ($148,504).

## Repository Contents

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Technical**: Power Query, Excel, data cleaning, data transformation, data analysis.
- **Analytical**: Trend analysis, insight generation, attention to detail.
- **Professional**: Problem-solving, communication of complex findings.
